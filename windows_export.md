#Step-by-Step Guide

Install Rust: Make sure you have Rust installed. You can install it using rustup if you haven't done so already:

bash:

    curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh

Install the Cross-Compilation Toolchain: You need to install the appropriate target for Windows. For example, to compile for Windows x86_64, run:

bash:

    rustup target add x86_64-pc-windows-gnu

For 32-bit Windows, use:

bash:

    rustup target add i686-pc-windows-gnu

Install MinGW: You'll also need a cross-compiler. On most Linux distributions, you can install MinGW, which provides the necessary tools. For example, on Ubuntu, you can run:

bash:

    sudo apt-get install mingw-w64

Set Up Your Cargo.toml: Make sure your Cargo.toml does not have any dependencies that are specific to Linux.

Compile Your Code: Use cargo build with the --target flag to specify the Windows target. For example, to build for 64-bit Windows:

bash:

    cargo build --target x86_64-pc-windows-gnu

For 32-bit Windows:

bash:

    cargo build --target i686-pc-windows-gnu

Locate the Executable: After a successful build, the Windows executable will be located in the target/x86_64-pc-windows-gnu/debug (or i686-pc-windows-gnu for 32-bit) directory.
